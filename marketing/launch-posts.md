1/ I used to wake up and immediately check emails.

Stressed before my feet hit the floor.

So I built something to fix that 👇

2/ Daily Spark sends you a fresh wallpaper + powerful quote every morning at 6am.

You wake up to inspiration instead of anxiety.

3/ How it works:
• Pick your theme (Stoicism, productivity, success, fitness)
• We generate a unique wallpaper overnight
• It lands in your inbox before sunrise

4/ There's even an iOS Shortcut that auto-sets it as your wallpaper while you sleep.

Zero effort. Maximum impact.

5/ The cost? Less than a coffee a week.

What you see first matters. Make it count.

The first thing you see each morning shapes your entire day.

For most of us, that's emails. Slack. News. Stress.

I wanted something different.

So I built Daily Spark — a simple service that delivers a beautiful wallpaper and motivational quote to your inbox every morning before you wake up.

The concept is simple:
→ Choose what motivates you (stoicism, productivity, success, fitness)
→ We craft a unique wallpaper overnight using AI
→ You wake up to intention, not anxiety

There's even an iOS Shortcut that auto-sets it as your lock screen while you sleep. Completely hands-free.

It's a small thing. But small things compound.

If you're someone who values starting the day with purpose, I'd love for you to try it:

Free for 7 days. Then less than a coffee a week.

Title: I automated my morning motivation — here's how

I'm not a morning person. Used to wake up, grab my phone, and immediately get sucked into emails/news/doom.

Bad way to start the day.

So I built a simple system: every morning at 6am, I get a fresh wallpaper with a motivational quote delivered to my inbox. I set up an iOS Shortcut to auto-apply it as my lock screen overnight.

Now the first thing I see isn't chaos — it's a reminder of what matters.

I turned it into a small product called Daily Spark if anyone wants to try it: [link]

But honestly, you could DIY something similar:
- Save 30 quote images to your phone
- Set up a Shortcut to rotate them daily
- Schedule it to run at 5am

The point isn't the tool — it's being intentional about what you see first.

Anyone else have morning rituals that help you start focused?

Title: Launched Daily Spark — $0 to first paying customer in 2 weeks

Hey IH! 

Just launched my first product of the year: Daily Spark.

**What it does:**
Sends subscribers a beautiful AI-generated wallpaper + motivational quote every morning before they wake up.

**Why I built it:**
I noticed my mornings were being hijacked by email/Slack anxiety. Wanted to be more intentional about the first thing I see. Built it for myself, decided to productize it.

**The stack:**
- Next.js 14 + Tailwind
- Replicate (FLUX Schnell) for image gen (~$0.003/image)
- Resend for email delivery
- Stripe for payments
- Vercel for hosting

**Costs:**
- ~$0.10/user/month all-in
- Pricing: $9/mo or $79/year
- Margins: ~98%

**What's working:**
- The iOS Shortcut angle (auto-set wallpaper) is a differentiator
- "Less than a coffee a week" resonates
- Free trial converts better than I expected

**What I'm figuring out:**
- Distribution (organic vs paid?)
- Whether to add more themes/customization
- Retention strategies

Would love feedback or questions. Happy to share more details on anything!
